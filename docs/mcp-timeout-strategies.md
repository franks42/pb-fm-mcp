# MCP Timeout Strategies: Server-Side vs Client-Side Polling

## Overview

This document analyzes optimal timeout and polling strategies for Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementations, specifically comparing server-side blocking operations versus client-side (Claude-managed) timing. The analysis reveals that the optimal strategy depends heavily on the user interface context and expected response time requirements.

## Key Finding: User Interface Context Determines Strategy

The fundamental insight is that **webpage-driven interfaces require different timeout strategies** than standalone AI agent implementations due to user experience expectations and real-time responsiveness requirements.

## Claude MCP Tool Timeout Behavior

### Observed Timeout Limits
- **Claude.ai Web Interface**: 30-60 seconds per MCP tool call
- **Claude Desktop Application**: 60-120 seconds per MCP tool call  
- **API Integrations**: Configurable, typically 30-300 seconds depending on implementation

### Factors Affecting Timeouts
- **Network conditions** and server response times
- **Tool complexity** and processing requirements
- **Claude's conversation context** length and token usage
- **Platform-specific limits** (web vs desktop vs API environments)
- **Server load** and resource availability

## Strategy Comparison: Two Approaches

### Approach 1: Server-Side Blocking (MCP Server Waits)

#### Implementation
```python
async def get_next_directive(self) -> DirectiveResponse:
    # Block and wait UP TO timeout limit for a directive
    timeout_seconds = 45  # Conservative estimate
    
    try:
        # BLPOP blocks until item available or timeout
        result = redis_client.blpop("directive_queue", timeout=timeout_seconds)
        
        if result:
            queue_name, directive_json = result
            directive_data = json.loads(directive_json)
            return build_directive_response(directive_data)
        else:
            # Timeout reached - normal behavior
            return DirectiveResponse(
                has_directive=False,
                next_action="POLL_AGAIN",
                instructions="Timeout reached, call get_next_directive() again immediately"
            )
    except Exception as e:
        return handle_error_response(e)
```

#### User Experience Timeline
```
0.0s: User types "Generate sales report" in webpage
0.1s: Webpage shows "Sending to Claude..."
0.2s: Directive added to Redis queue
