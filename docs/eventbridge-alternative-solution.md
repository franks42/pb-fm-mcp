# Alternative Documentation Synchronization Solutions

## Issue with EventBridge
- AWS EventBridge deployment failed due to insufficient permissions
- User account lacks `events:DescribeRule` permission
- Adding permissions might require admin-level access

## Alternative Solutions (Ranked by Simplicity)

### 1. **Manual Post-Deploy Hook** (Simplest)
```bash
# Enhanced deployment script with docs validation
sam build && sam deploy --resolve-s3 && ./scripts/validate-docs.sh
```
- ✅ No additional AWS permissions required
- ✅ Guaranteed to run after deployment
- ✅ Simple to implement and debug
- ❌ Requires manual execution

### 2. **GitHub Actions with Delay** (Recommended)
```yaml
- name: Deploy to AWS
  run: sam build && sam deploy --resolve-s3
- name: Wait for API to stabilize
  run: sleep 30
- name: Validate and update docs
  run: ./scripts/validate-and-update-docs.sh
```
- ✅ Automated execution
- ✅ No AWS permission issues  
- ✅ Built-in retry and error handling
- ✅ Can notify on failures
- ❌ Small timing window (mitigated by validation)

### 3. **API Health Check Webhook** (Future Enhancement)
- Add an endpoint to our API: `/api/trigger-docs-update`
- Secured with API key
- Called after successful deployment
- Can be triggered by CI/CD or manually

### 4. **CloudFormation Custom Resource** (Complex)
- Custom Lambda resource in CloudFormation
- Runs only on successful stack updates
- Requires additional Lambda permissions

## Recommended Implementation: GitHub Actions

Since EventBridge requires additional permissions, let's implement the GitHub Actions solution with proper validation.
