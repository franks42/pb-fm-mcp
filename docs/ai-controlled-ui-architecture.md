# AI-Controlled UI Architecture: MCP Server as Web Interface

## Overview

This document analyzes the architectural feasibility and implications of using an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to simultaneously serve as a web server with an AI-controllable user interface. This approach enables AI agents to dynamically manipulate web interfaces through MCP function calls while maintaining conversational interactions with users.

## Core Concept

The architecture combines:
- **MCP Server**: Handles AI agent communication and tool calls
- **Web Server**: Serves user interface and handles HTTP requests  
- **AI-Controlled UI**: Interface elements that can be manipulated by AI through MCP functions
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Users input prompts, AI responds with both text and UI changes

## Feasibility Assessment: ✅ **Highly Feasible**

The concept is architecturally sound and technically implementable with current technologies. The unified server approach eliminates many common integration challenges while enabling novel interaction patterns.
