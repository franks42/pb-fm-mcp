## Does the AWS Lambda Web Adapter require a container deployment

No, the AWS Lambda Web Adapter can be used with both container deployments and Zip package deployments for Lambda functions. 
While it's frequently highlighted with container deployments because it makes it easier to run existing web applications without needing to significantly modify them, it's not a requirement. 
Here's how it works in both cases

With Container Images: You include the Lambda Web Adapter binary in your Dockerfile and deploy the container image to Lambda.
With Zip Packages: You attach the Lambda Web Adapter as a layer to your Lambda function and configure specific environment variables and a custom handler script. 
So you have flexibility in how you choose to package and deploy your Lambda function when using the Web Adapter. 

### Compare the Zip package and container image approaches

Both Zip packages and container images are valid approaches for deploying Lambda functions, and the best choice depends on your specific needs, team expertise, and the complexity of your application. 
Zip packages

#### Pros
Simplicity and Ease of Implementation: Zip deployments are generally straightforward. You package your code and dependencies, then upload them directly or via S3. There's no need for Dockerfiles or container registries.
Lower Potential Costs: Avoiding ECR can potentially reduce costs, especially for smaller deployments or numerous function versions.
Potentially Faster Cold Starts (for smaller sizes): Zip functions can experience faster cold start times for smaller deployments, as the system doesn't need to pull and initialize a container image. However, this advantage diminishes with larger package sizes. 

#### Cons
Deployment Package Size Restriction: Zip deployments have a 50MB size limit (compressed), which can be limiting for large dependencies or data files.
Limited Environment Customization: You have less control over the execution environment compared to containers, according to da415.com.
Potential Dependency Conflicts: Managing dependencies within a Zip package can sometimes lead to issues if local environments differ from the Lambda environment.
Updating Layers: If you use Lambda layers to manage shared dependencies, updating them involves creating new layer versions and updating each function to use them, which can become cumbersome. 

### Container images

#### Pros
Increased Flexibility and Customization: You have more control over the runtime environment, including using custom runtimes, according to KnowBe4.
Larger Deployment Package Size: Container images allow deployment packages up to 10GB, accommodating larger applications and dependencies.
Consistency Across Environments: Docker's "Build Once, Run Anywhere" approach helps ensure consistent behavior between your local environment and Lambda.
Easier Dependency Management: Dependencies can be managed directly within the container image, streamlining the process.
Improved Performance (for larger applications): Container images can offer better cold start performance for larger applications compared to Zip packages, especially when dependencies are substantial.
Support for Multi-Architecture Images: Container images simplify building and deploying for different architectures like x86 and ARM, which is increasingly relevant with Apple silicon becoming popular, according to AJ Stuyvenberg.
Enhanced Portability: Container images can be easily adapted to run on other container platforms or services like Fargate or App Runner if needed. 

#### Cons
Increased Complexity: Building and managing Docker images requires knowledge of Docker and image optimization.
Need for ECR Management: You'll need to use Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to store and manage your container images, which adds an additional layer of management and potential costs, according to KnowBe4.
Potential Security Risks: Vulnerabilities in base images or other layers within the container image can introduce security risks, necessitating regular image updates and scans.
Potentially Slower Cold Starts (for smaller sizes): Pulling and initializing larger container images can lead to slower cold starts compared to smaller Zip deployments. 
Choosing the right approach

For simpler applications, quick prototypes, or internal tools with minimal dependencies, Zip deployments offer a faster feedback loop and straightforward deployment.
For production workloads, complex applications requiring custom runtimes or specific dependencies, or teams already familiar with Docker, container images provide greater flexibility, control, and a more robust deployment strategy, according to Medium.
For applications with larger dependencies (e.g., NodeJS applications over ~30MB, Python applications over ~200MB), container images often outperform Zip deployments in terms of cold start performance, according to AJ Stuyvenberg. 
Ultimately, the best approach depends on your specific use case, team's expertise, and priorities regarding flexibility, performance, cost, and security.
